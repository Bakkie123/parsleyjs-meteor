Parsley.js
==========

Meteor packaging for Parsley.js.

If I forgot to upgrade to the latest Parsley version, please start a new issue
or find a way to notify me and I'll happily upgrade it for you. Or if you want
to be nice and save me a few seconds; fork it, make a PR and I'll merge it.

If you are planning to clone this repository you should know that it contains
a submodule pointing to the parsley.js repository. `parsleyjs` directory will initially
be empty and you will need to initialize it after cloning by doing the following:

```
git submodule update --init
```
